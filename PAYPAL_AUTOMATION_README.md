   - GitHub Pages automatically uses HTTPS

3. **Data Protection:**
   - Limit Google Sheets access to necessary team members only
   - Use Google Sheets data protection features
   - Regular backups of registration data

4. **PayPal Security:**
   - Use Production credentials only for live registrations
   - Use Sandbox for all testing
   - Monitor PayPal dashboard for suspicious activity

5. **Testing:**
   - Always test in PayPal Sandbox before going live
   - Create test registrations to verify the complete flow
   - Check all webhook endpoints are responding
